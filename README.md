# RoadTestBC

A simple script to help your road test.

## How to use

1. Install necessary python packages.
1. Set your ICBC credentials as hard coded at begining of the script; also the desired date range.
1. `python3 road_test.py`
1. You should see some credentials keep printing out and trying to search for a valid road test.
1. If a spot is found, you'll hear audio notification and also receive SMS for verification code.
1. Ignore the printed `curl` command as it seems not working; once you receive SMS, you can simply redo the booking from ICBC web UI, as this spot is locked for you.
1. Ready to go!

Notice: macOS only.
